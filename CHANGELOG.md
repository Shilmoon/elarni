# Changelog

Notable changes to Elarni. Versions follow `pubspec.yaml`.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- RU routing from runetfreedom's geofiles works again: its geosite.dat passed the
  64 MiB limit. Downloaded geofiles (up to 256 MiB) are streamed to disk and trimmed
  to the categories your rules use; with Reduce routing-data size off, a file over
  64 MiB fails the refresh with a clear message.
- Android: connections no longer hang when the phone reuses a port the tunnel still
  held in TIME_WAIT, and connection bursts are no longer refused.

### Performance

- Faster downloads and connects on every platform: WireGuard, QUIC (Hysteria2,
  XHTTP/3, TUIC), XHTTP and the TUN stacks got larger, bounded buffers, and a stalled
  QUIC stream no longer freezes its connection. On Windows, 8-stream downloads are
  1.2-3.3x faster on 22 of 24 protocols, with 1.5-5x less CPU per GB.
- Server-first protocols (SMTP, IMAP, MySQL, SSH and others) get their greeting at
  once instead of after up to 0.7 s.
- Per-app routing looks a connection's process up once instead of once per rule.
- The core returns memory after traffic stops (desktop) and returns freed memory to
  the system (Android).

### Changed

- Release files are built on GitHub-hosted runners and come with build provenance
  (`gh attestation verify`) and a Sigstore-signed `SHA256SUMS`; see docs/RELEASING.md.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-11-01

First open-source release.

### Added

- Release builds check this repository's releases once a day and show a notice
  when a newer version exists (Settings › General › Update feed; nothing installs).
- Settings › General has a language choice, English or Russian.
- Android: the Quick Settings tile names the connected server.

### Changed

- Every platform uses Elarni identifiers: `com.elarni.*` bundle, package and
  desktop IDs, `Elarni` data folders and registry keys, `/var/lib/elarni`,
  `/run/elarni` and `/etc/elarni` for the Linux service, and `elarni://` links.
  Builds from before this change are a separate app: remove the earlier build
  first, then install this release and re-add subscriptions. On Windows, the
  earlier build's uninstaller, or `elarni.exe --unregister` for its portable ZIP,
  releases its link handlers and login item. Backups from earlier builds cannot
  be restored.
- Desktop: per-app routing is its own Routing tab, subscriptions open with their
  servers expanded, and the Home server card is shorter.
- Connection recording is left out of release builds; it ships only in builds
  made with `ELARNI_RECORDING`.

### Security

- tokio 1.53.3 (RUSTSEC-2026-0386) and golang.org/x/net 0.62.0 (GO-2026-6860,
  GO-2026-6866).
